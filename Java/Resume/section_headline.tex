    My Master's degree and seven years of software engineering expertise make me a seasoned back-end developer. I have seven years of Java and two years of Clojure experience. I also know Hibernate, JDBC, Spring Boot, and design patterns. I can use Agile methods to create high-quality software during testing and production. My strengths are Dockerization, domain-driven design, microservices deployment, and test-driven development. I want to foster innovation and scalability.}
