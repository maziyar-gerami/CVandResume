	{Community Detection in Social Network}{2017 - 2018}
	{\github{https://github.com/maziyar-gerami/CommunityDetecion}{} {Freelancing} }
	{This project focuses on community detection in social networks, a fundamental task in network analysis. Community detection aims to identify groups of nodes within a network that are more densely connected to each other than to nodes outside of their group. This README provides an overview of the project and how to get started.}
