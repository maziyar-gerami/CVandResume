	{Friendship Recommendation Algorithm}{2017 - 2018}
	{\github{https://github.com/maziyar-gerami/friendship-recommendation}{} {Freelancing} }
	{This project focuses on developing a novel algorithm for friendship recommendation in social networks. The algorithm leverages the analysis of structural and profile-based mutual friends graphs to provide personalized friendship suggestions to users. The goal is to enhance the user experience and foster meaningful connections in the social network.}

	{Improved TDOA-Based Localization Accuracy in Wireless Sensor Networks Using RBF Neural Network}{2017 - 2018}
	{\github{https://github.com/maziyar-gerami/LocatingWSNTDOA}{} {Freelancing} }
	{This project aims to improve the localization accuracy in wireless sensor networks by enhancing the TDOA-based method. We employ Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Networks as a novel approach to address the challenges associated with traditional TDOA localization methods.}

	{Community Detection in Social Network}{2017 - 2018}
	{\github{https://github.com/maziyar-gerami/CommunityDetecion}{} {Freelancing} }
	{This project focuses on community detection in social networks, a fundamental task in network analysis. Community detection aims to identify groups of nodes within a network that are more densely connected to each other than to nodes outside of their group. This README provides an overview of the project and how to get started.}
