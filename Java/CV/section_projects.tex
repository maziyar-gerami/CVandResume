	{Friendship Recommendation Algorithm}{2017 - 2018}
	{\github{https://github.com/maziyar-gerami/friendship-recommendation}{} {Freelancing} }
	{This project focuses on developing a novel algorithm for friendship recommendation in social networks. The algorithm leverages the analysis of structural and profile-based mutual friends graphs to provide personalized friendship suggestions to users. The goal is to enhance the user experience and foster meaningful connections in the social network.}
